                These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of <strong>voicenotetools.com</strong> (the “Service”).
                By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
            </p>

            <h2>1) The service</h2>
            <p>
                The Service provides in-browser tools to convert audio files (e.g., WhatsApp voice notes) into other
                formats.
                The conversion typically happens on your device using your browser.
            </p>

            <h2>2) Acceptable use</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You may use the Service only if you comply with these Terms and applicable laws.</li>
                <li>You agree not to misuse the Service (e.g., attempt to break, overload, or exploit it).</li>
                <li>You are responsible for the files you choose to convert and for ensuring you have the right to use
                    them.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3) No warranties</h2>
            <p>
                The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not guarantee that the Service will be
                uninterrupted,
                error-free, or available at all times, especially on devices with limited memory or older browsers.
            </p>

            <h2>4) Limitation of liability</h2>
            <p>
                To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or
                consequential
                damages arising out of your use of the Service.
            </p>

            <h2>5) Advertising</h2>
            <p>
                The Service may display ads, including via Google AdSense. Ads are provided by third parties and we do
                not control
                the content of every ad shown.
            </p>

            <h2>6) Changes</h2>
            <p>
                We may update the Service and these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Service after changes means
                you accept
                the updated Terms.
            </p>
